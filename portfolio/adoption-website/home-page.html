					<h2>Sam</h2>
					<h3>German Shepherd</h3>
					<p> Sam is a very nice dog and loves all people. He knows basic obedience but will take off from you if off leash. He has jumped a 4'fence. He knows how to go slow and brace for a person that was having mobility issues. He is crate trained and will let you know when he needs to go outside. He loves to play with a rope toy and will play fetch for hours. His owner can no longer physically handle him as she is growing frail due to a medical condition. Sam has very good search behaviors. He would make anyone an excellent running partner.<p>

					<h2>Bud</h2>
					<h3>Lab</h3>
					<p>Bud is a sweet pup who will definitely put you in a good mood. This goofy guy has a bright sunny smile to match his personality. He loves to play fetch especially with tennis balls and enjoys playing with other dogs. He is housetrained and knows a few basic commands, but may need some additional training to help improve a few things such as walking on a leash. Bud is very affectionate, loves to be around kids, and does well with other dogs. He is unknown with cats and approved for kids 10 and up. <p>

					<h2>Dekota</h2>
					<h3>Unknown</h3>
					<p> Dakota is looking for a forever home! His foster mom raves about how much energy he has! He LOVES playing fetch! He will do about anything for a ball or anything else you are willing to throw for him. He would love a home that would do agility, flyball, rally, doc diving, or some other dog sport with him so that he could use his nose, chase a ball and jump high. Even though he has lots of energy, he will go inside and settle down nicely after a nice long exercise session, but he needs a couple long sessions each day.  He attaches to a person fairly quickly and will give lots of love, but it would be best to be the only dog in the house.<p>
